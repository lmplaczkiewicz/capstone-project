Technologies Used: html scss javascript bootstrap handlebars npm ro

Unsolved Problems: I would want the textarea to function a bit better and have more versatility for a possible mobile version. I wasn't able to address the potential for a mobile ui due to time constraints.

Development Progress: Sat - Sun I began the project by planning via ERD phases and making a wireframe. I then started setting up my main resource, characters, in the back-end and then started on the front-end. I began by doing a basic html page with several buttons to test user CRU and Character CRUD. Once all the CRUD actions were working I linked the tables and re-tested the resources. Once CRUD was re-tested and working I began pushing forward with additional tables.

Mon - Tues I started adding additional tables and setting up my character select screen and then the tavern screen. I added in additional tables to the back-end; player_class, quest, monster. Then started implementing more handlebar items to display the various table data that was recieved.

Wed - Thurs I started combat logic and the associated join table between monsters and quests and added the weapon table for both characters and monsters. I added the fight screen area and began styling.
